            Since we ordered the list in the header alphabetically, it only makes sense to order the content alphabetically.
            I'm also going to change the "float-left"/"float-right" to maintain the original look of the left-right-left
            image structure.  Since we've also consolodated the CSS to have classes with the same value/pairs into one, we've reflected
            that here in the "Contents" section and the "Benefits" section.  "Sequential" = "Alphabetical" in my mind.

            NOTE: I realize I probably overthought this and what you REALLY meant by "sequential" is just the header attributes being in
            order in the HTML (i.e. h1, followed by h2, followed by h3).  I figured rather than put these sections back in
            non-alphabetical order, I'd just make note of my thought process and see what you guys think.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
